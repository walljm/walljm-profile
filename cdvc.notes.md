Cambridge Intelligence Conference Notes
------------------------

## Kinds of customers
* security
* investigation/criminology
* semantic relationships
* social network analysis
* networking
* threat analysis

## Whats New / Roadmap

* link gradients
* coloring individual bars on the timeline
* free glyph positioning
* **rectangular combos**!! Q3 or beyond
  
* creating combos directly from loaded data
  * lazy load the group information if you prefer

### Layouts
* Organic Layout (how is this different from a normal FDL?)

### Geospatial
* use map tile services from geospatial services
* put nodes on an image
  * we can use this for showing where something is in a building or server room floor plan

## Ideas and Suggestions for Cambridge

* Layered detail, show more or less detail/combos/groups at different zoom levels
* Automatically collapse multiple rels together and show the number in a glyph or by changing the rel width.
